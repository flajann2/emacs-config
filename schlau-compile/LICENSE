MIT License

Note well: This code is derived from a GPLv3 licensed code,
and only my modifications are MIT.

I am not a lawyer(!) and I don't care to get into the fine
hair-splitting details about whether my work here is MIT or GPLv3.
I am releasing this the way I release most of my code, as
MIT. If the authors of smart-compile ask, I will revert schlau-compile
to GPLv3.

I hate that we have all these open-source license options, and it has
created many difficulties with how code is packaged, etc.

So, you are free to make your own determination about this.
